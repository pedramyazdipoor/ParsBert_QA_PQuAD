## Extractive Question Answering 

In this project, I fine-tuned a customized version of the famous persian pre-trained language model [ParsBert](https://github.com/hooshvare/parsbert).

The dataset I used is [PQuAD](https://github.com/AUT-NLP/PQuAD) which is a crowd-sourced reading comprehension dataset on Persian Language. It includes 80,000 questions along with their answers, with 25% of the questions being unanswerable.
